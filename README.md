# Photography-website

This is my personal photography website, I used html, CSS and JavaScript (Vanilla in front-end, NodeJS in back-end). You can see the preview here: https://hanikene.herokuapp.com/

Project difficulties: 
The project tested my skill on how to display the images so the horizontal spacing will not change between pictures since they don't have the same height.

The solution:
I made a code that calculate the top space of every picture (with a position absolute) depending on the height of the previous pictures which are on the same column.
